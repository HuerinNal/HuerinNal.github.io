        <p class = "description">I am someone who enjoys going thrift shopping, playing card games, and collecting retro media. 
            My current strongest programming language is Python. I also have a solid understanding of JavaScript, Swift, HTML, and CSS with experience in C/C++, C#, and Java.
            My favorite thing about programming is that it gives me the ability to bring whatever I can imagine to life.
            Theres a lot for me to learn so I can make my visions real and I'm excited to learn how to do it.
